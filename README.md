Task 1
Using the if/else statement approach, I was able to develpo a code that squares each even number in the array and triples each odd number. I used the modulus operator to check if a given number is even or odd.

Task 2 
The formatArrayStrings function I used first checks if the input arrays have the same length and returns "Arrays must have the same length" if they don't.

Task 3
The createUserProfiles used an empty array to store user profile objects. userProfile has 3 properties;
- id 
- originalName and 
- modifiedName
